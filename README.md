# Network-Design-and-Facility-Location-Optimization
Goal: Determine optimal facility locations and capacities to minimize transportation and operating costs across three distinct business scenarios: manufacturing site location, distribution planning, and service facility siting.
Solution:
o	Cat Tower Manufacturer: Applied both Center of Gravity and Excel Solver optimization to determine the lowest-cost coordinates for a central assembly facility across suppliers and DCs, achieving improved cost precision through Solver.
o	DryIce Inc.: Designed an optimal manufacturing network by selecting 3 of 4 candidate plant locations and capacities, allocating 610,000 units across U.S. markets to meet demand with minimal fixed and transportation cost.
o	Farmers’ Bank: Used Huff’s gravity model to assess customer attraction toward a proposed bank branch versus a competitor. Integrated revenue forecasts, setup costs, and payback ratio analysis to support a facility investment decision.
Result:
o	Reduced facility siting costs for the cat tower company by $6,793 using Solver over COG method.
o	Created a $129.4M minimal-cost national manufacturing plan for DryIce Inc., meeting all market demands efficiently.
o	Supported Farmers’ Bank branch approval based on $878K in expected net profit and strong year-1 payback (0.85), validating branch viability despite competition.
